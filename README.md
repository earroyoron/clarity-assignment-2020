# clarityai-assignment
Solution for Clarity-AI assignment

## At a glance

The project is built with Kotlin, no frameworks, 
and [KotlinTest 3.3.2](https://github.com/kotest/kotest/blob/master/doc/reference.md) 
for testing.

## Usage

### Building the project

The project uses Gradle as the building tool
but _gradle wrapper is provided with the project_
so you don't need a gradle installation to build.

Just:

- Download or clone the project

`git clone https://github.com/earroyoron/clarity-assignment-2020`

In this repository you can see 
my practice of doing "atomic commits"
and "Test Driven Development" with baby-steps
in development.

- build the project 

`./gradlew build`

- run the project with 

`TODO: main WIP

## Continuous Integration (Circle-CI)

From the very first time the
project was developed using a CI tool 
to enforce a TDD and simulate a "going to production from the 1st day"
approach.
